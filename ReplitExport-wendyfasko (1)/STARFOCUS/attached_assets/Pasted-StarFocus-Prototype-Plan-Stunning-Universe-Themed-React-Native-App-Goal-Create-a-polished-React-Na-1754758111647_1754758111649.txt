StarFocus Prototype Plan: Stunning Universe-Themed React Native App
Goal:
Create a polished React Native prototype with:

Starry, cosmic UI — dark mode, animated stars, nebula gradients, glowing buttons

Core Features:

Phonological drag-and-drop game with star rewards & Lexi guiding

Customizable TTS for uploaded texts with speed/voice/color options

Speech-to-Text dictation with live word prediction & mind-map style organizer

Onboarding quiz with personalized settings

Modular design to add ADHD/ASD tools later

Accessibility: dyslexia-friendly fonts, color overlays, WCAG 2.1 compliant

Smooth animations: letter drag, star sparkles, gentle transitions

Sound effects: gentle cosmic sounds & rewarding chimes

Design & UI
Background: animated starfield or slow-moving nebula gradient

Typography: OpenDyslexic font, glowing text with subtle outer glows

Colors: deep space blues, purples, with neon accents (turquoise, gold)

Buttons: rounded, softly glowing, with star icons

Lexi: a cute futuristic robot avatar that can talk (animated speech bubble)

Feedback: twinkling star animations for success, gentle pulse on interaction

Tech & Tools
React Native + Reanimated 2 for smooth animations

Lottie for star sparkle animations

expo-speech for TTS (or react-native-tts on bare workflow)

Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for dictation & word prediction API

react-native-svg for star & constellation visuals

Context API or Zustand for state management, modular and scalable

Accessibility hooks and custom focus controls

Asset management: starry backgrounds, robot avatar, sound effects (free sources or custom made)

Prototype Features & Flow
Splash & Onboarding

Cosmic splash screen with animated starfield

5-question onboarding quiz with glowing selection highlights

Store user preferences

Phonological Game

Drag letters to slots to form words (like “cat”)

Letters have subtle glow & particle trails when dragged

On success, stars sparkle and Lexi congratulates via TTS

Option to toggle star rewards & sound effects

TTS Text Reader

Upload or paste text (for prototype: paste text box)

Controls for voice, speed, and dyslexia-friendly overlays

Highlight words as read aloud with subtle glow

Background changes to reduce visual stress (blue, purple, sepia overlays)

STT Dictation & Organizer

Tap microphone, speak, see words appear live with confidence scores

Basic word prediction below input

Save dictations and organize with simple mind map UI (nodes connected by lines)

Lexi offers encouragement & tips

Settings & Profile

Change font size, color overlays, TTS speed, star rewards, Lexi presence

Toggle dark/light star themes

Next Steps for Coding
I can start with a fully themed app skeleton including:

Animated starry background (Lottie or custom SVG animation)

Onboarding quiz UI with starry buttons

Phonological drag-and-drop with glowing letters and star reward animations

Basic TTS read-aloud for pasted text with highlighting

Simple STT UI mockup (actual speech API integration later)

Want me to send the first React Native prototype code for this universe-themed skeleton?
Or prefer to see mockups and UI designs first?

Bonus: Sound & Animation Ideas
Ambient space sounds loop softly in background

“Whoosh” sounds when dragging letters

Sparkle chime on correct word formation

Lexi’s speech bubble with typing dots and voice playback animation
